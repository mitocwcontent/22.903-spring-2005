Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: Arrangement of hours to fit students' requirements.

Prerequisites
-------------

A 12 unit graduate course, prerequisite: [22.101](/courses/22-101-applied-nuclear-physics-fall-2006), [22.51](/courses/22-51-quantum-theory-of-radiation-interactions-fall-2012/).

Description
-----------

The purpose of this course is to discuss modern techniques of generation of x-ray photons and neutrons and then follow with selected applications of newly developed photon and neutron scattering spectroscopic techniques to investigations of properties of condensed matter which are of interest to nuclear engineers.

This course addresses the following areas of photon and neutron scattering spectroscopy: neutron sources, photon sources, neutron scattering theory, light and X-ray scattering theory, linear response theory, inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy, quasielastic neutron scattering spectroscopy, photon correlation spectroscopy, and inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy.
